A denial reaches the WORKER as a visible message and propagates no further — never to a
caller, never as a catchable condition. Every row above states a grant or an explicit death;
a step that dies says so in the output, never as a false "done"/"skipped"/"clean".

- **read** denied → refuse before scanning; never a false clean bill.
- **write** denied → report the change as NOT applied — never claim done.
- **network** denied/unfetchable → `⚠️ unverified: check [source]`.
- **spawn** denied → degrade per Escalation's own capability-lever fallback (never fake
  parallelism) and say the fan-out did not happen — already discharged there; a row above
  is only for a spawn this skill does OUTSIDE tier escalation.
